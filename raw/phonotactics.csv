The guild brothers were bound together by elaborate rituals, by special imagery, and by their songs. This song is about the weavers’ guild and refers to the famous mechanical engineer Joseph Marie Jacquard (1752–1834), inventor of the loom that bears his name. Jacquard lived in Lyon, situated “at the confluence of the Saône and the Rhône” (mentioned in this song), and his invention contributed to the prosperity of the town. The Roman goddess Minerva, renowned for her skill in weaving, was the patroness of artisans, particularly weavers; since it is recounted in Ovid’s Metamorphosis (VI: 5–54) that she turned the mortal maiden Arachne into a spider for daring to vie with her in that art.

The title, “The Web of the Virgin,” indicates that just as the spider weaves its web, so the love of the Virgin weaves a chain that links the hearts of all the compagnons.","Male leader, male chorus",Male Voice; Male Voices,Men,"Dans l’art brillant où Jacquard fut grand maître, Or il advint qu’un honnête aspirant
Se demandait: “Quand pourrai-je connaître Du beau devoir le secret si charmant?
Douce Minerve, ah soyez mon mécène Pour obtenir ces insignes faveurs.

Refrain (tutti):
Car je voudrais pouvoir tisser la chaîne Qui doit servir à lier tous les coeurs.” (2x)

Au confluent de la Saône et du Rhône Il s’endormit, fit des songes heureux.
L’ont transporté sur les marches du trône Environné de rayons lumineux.
Tout était grand dans ce riant domaine
 La joie et l’or se mêlangeaient aux fleurs.

Refrain (tutti):
Car c’était là que se tissait la chaîne
Qui doit servir à lier tous les coeurs. (2x)

Translation: In the brilliant art of which Jacquard was past master / Now it happened that an honest apprentice / Wondered: “When can I learn / The enchanting secret of this beautiful task? / Sweet Minerva, ah, be my patroness, / So that I may obtain these signal favors.” // Chorus:  “For I want to be able to weave the chain / That can help to link all hearts together.” // At the confluence of the Saône and the Rhône [site of the city of Lyon], / He fell asleep and had happy dreams. / He was transported to the steps of a throne / Surrounded by luminous rays. / All was splendid in this smiling realm, / Joy and gold were mingled with flowers. // Chorus: For it was there that the chain was woven / That can help to link all hearts together.",,Claudie Marcel-Dubois; Marguerite Pichonet-Andral,1949,Columbia Records,"Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music: France.

The ceremony is described as ""the idea is that the saturation of the body with the liquor typifies and produces the saturation of the earth with rain. Every act of the procedure is accompanied with ceremonial singing or oratory describing rain and growth.""

This particular tribe's singing is distinguished by a softness of tone quality, tenderness of vocal presentation, and calmness and control of dynamic that's hardly exceeding a forte. These singing techniques clearly difer the Tohono O'odham's singing from the Pueblo methods. This song is performed in a slow tempo and consists of numerous long sustained notes, especially at the end of phrases. ""The upward interval of a sixth, relatively rare in North American Indian music, occupies an exposed position and contributes considerably to the individuality of the Papago music."" Spanish influence could be noticed in the style of singing and music of the Papago tribe.

Dancers have a various collection of dances, as well as comic and serious. In every repertoire of performances, a dancer mimics a hunted deer. The movements of the deer are realistically imitated as he grazes and then picks up his head to look around or violently leaps away, consistently with nervousness of a startled animal. 

Three or four musicians accompany the Deer dancer by singing the deer song in low-pictched voices in unison and playing on notched rasping sticks and the water drum. The rasping stick is a notched strip of wood played by setting down one of the ends on an inverted half gourd and stroking it with another stick. The water drum, that used in this recording, is an unusually interesting instrument. It consists of a half gourd laying on the surface with the open side downward in a wooden bowl filled with water and beaten accordingly with the rasping sticks.

The composer of this song was hanged for murder in an Edmonton jail several years ago. A few of his friends who visited him in jail still remember the sad song he sang there, but all agree that the present singer sings it best. Perhaps the fact that he is blind gives him special feeling for the mood of disillusionment which surrounds both the melody and words. While songs of this sort are not common, they do express the Indian's disillusionment not only with his own traditional values but with all the superficial trappings of modern civilization, both material and spiritual.","William Burn Stick, hand drum",Male Voice; Hand Drum,Men,"Translation:

Their dancing in the forest is equally fine, in many respects a great deal finer, but it is accompanied only by song, sticks and handclaps. In the village they borrow drums, clappers and a mgungu gong. 

A steady stick beat that never falters through the dance starts the music. The ""birds"" in the background are in fact Pygmies. The mgungu, drums and voices corne in together and the dance begins with little delay. The hooting sound which could be mistaken for horns is also made by Pygmies. They form a circle, women facing men. They hoot a chorus, with snatches of solo being passed from one to another, singing encouragement as each dancer leaps into the center and performs in turn. The dancing is a game between feet and drum, the drum leading the feet for a while, then the dancer suddenly syncopating his step and making the drum follow him. After displaying his virtuosity as a dancer he jigs along the line of girls and eventually leads one out into the center for a brisk whirl. Both return to their places and another couple takes the floor. As dancers the Pygmies are inexhaustible. Dancing by firelight into the early hours of the morning, they truly earn the title given them by the ancient Egyptians: The Dancers of God."" (Colin M. Turnbull and Francis S.

Note the short tonal range of the melody and the simple verse form characteristic of the oldest and most primitive songs in the tradition. 

These songs have a function similar to the Lazaričke pesme. In some regions, texts for the kraljičke pesme were identical to lazaričke pesme, but they were sung to a distinctive melody called kraljičin glas, or “Queen’s melody.” Each verse ends with the incantation, “Lado,” the name of an old Slavic god.

For generations bards have sung through the land of the deeds of heroes past and present. These songs have traditionally been accompanied by the gusle, a bowed instrument with one horsehair string. Styles of playing this instrument and of singing the epics vary from one district to another, and to those who are deeply immersed in this tradition individual styles also vary. The singing of Lazar Radak in this recording belongs to the southern Herzegovinian and Montenegrin style, with modifications probably developed during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He sings here the beginning of a new song composed around events of the World War II.","Lazar Radak, vocal and gusle",Male Voice; Gusle,Men,"Oj! Neka pravde, sloge i slobode,

O, long live Justice, Harmony, and Freedom! / Long life to all the leaders of the people. / They guard over the freedom of all the people. / In the year one thousand, nine hundred and forty-one, / The poor enslaved people cried out. / Those miserably enslaved from every region, / From all Bosnia and Herzegovina, / From far and wide in rocky Dalmatia, / From across the Lika and from the Slovene land, / And from Croatia, that proud district. / From Slavonia, that rich and level plain, / From Srijem, Bačka, and the Banat  / (O, my hearers, o golden apple!) / And from Serbia, our own dear land, / From Montenegro with her rocky ramparts. / From the time those precious boulders rose from the earth, / When black mud fell on our people, / The shining sun rose in the east / And looked upon suffering people. / What did those fiends do with our people? / They enslaved, burned, and tormented them. / They raped women and decapitated men. / A gun fired from bitter Krajina, / From Krajina, famous Kozara. / It resounded over there, from Grmeč, / Where poor people roamed the wilderness. / It resounded from Grmeč to Drvar, / Where revolt first broke out. / Who was first decapitated? / Kalaba Bogdan, the director. / It resounded from Zeleni to even Janj. / Revolt rose from Koun. / An immense uproar from every forest. / Oh, people rose, / People rose up from every corner of the land, / Those with axes and those with spears. / And Šolaja from Kozilo shouts, / And clearly, with ringing voice, he proclaims: / “Follow me, my brothers swift! / Take your deadly spears!” / If you could only see those soldiers, those lads. / Among them were fifty brothers from Marković family — / A youthful army, a magnificent parade / With Rada out in front. / If you could only see, my dear boy, / That Vlatković was among them. / All heroes praise him. / They call him a new Obilić. / And he encourages his army: / “Be ready […].” / Everyone waits for the clock / To strike at the gates of Šipovo town. / They took Šipovo around dawn, / And sang a heroic song: / “Be merry — better days are coming, / Young partisans, accept the challenge.” / This, my brothers, is how this song was born. / May our commander live long! / Listeners, hear me. / May God bless our Marshal Tito.",,Peter Kennedy,1951,Columbia Records,Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music: Yugoslavia.
