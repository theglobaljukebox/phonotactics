Bentara noa, Larre berrian and Gogoan nerabilen are three artaxuriketa, corn shucking songs sung by the young women during the winter, when young people of both sexes would get together to shuck the corn. These work sessions usually became song sessions, mostly with a courtship theme: the songs become a kind of game naming the young man who was attractive to each girl. As is customary, the girls who sang for Alan Lomax are identified by the names of their houses: Andresa Ariztimuño (Apezenea), Mikaela Ariztimuño (Apezenea), Engrazia Ariztimuño (Etxeberria), Maria Josefa Araniguria (Maisuenea), Txarito Araniguria (Maisuenea) and Rosario Zabaleta (Baztarrika).",Alan Lomax with Jeannette Bell,1952,Westminster,"Spanish Recordings, ACE Online Archive","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress",,,Songs and Dances of Spain: Volume 6: The Spanish Basques.

Better known as Dock Boggs, he was a coal miner all his working life and, in his early years, spent his spare time entertaining the mining communities of the southwestern Virginia and eastern Kentucky border where he lived. His emotional banjo playing and stark vocals made haunting music that reflected the economic circumstances of both the black and white miners whose musical traditions he encountered and absorbed. It is the melancholy engendered by listening to his music that proved his greatest appeal, a mood that is infused with the blues of his black mining neighbors. Based on the “Darling Corey” theme, “Country Blues” comes from the tradition of white blues ballads that developed alongside their black counterparts during the final years of the nineteenth century. The music of Boggs and his ilk became familiar to Alan Lomax during the late 1930s when he began studying the catalogues of commercial phonograph companies, looking for parallels to the music that he and his father were collecting in the field.

With silver and gold,

This poor girl she was found
With a ball through her heart,
Lying cold upon the ground.

Before that sad day,
They picked up her cold body
And carried hit away.
Oh, they gathered their Winchesters,
They chased me all around,
They found this poor boy
In the fur edge of town.
Oh, they send me to Frankfurt
I've been there before,
I wore the ball and chain
Till it made my ankles sore. 
I courted her through years
For to make her my wife,
I loved her too dearly
To take her precious life.

We have met, we have met, said he,
For I've just come from a salt salt sea,
And it's all for the sake of thee.
I have refused a king' s daughter fair,
I'm sure she'd have married me,
I have refused a crown of gold,
And it's all for the sake of thee.
If you have refused a king's daughter fair,
I'm sure you are to blame,
For I have married to a house carpenter,
And I'm sure he's a very fine man.
If I was to leave my house carpenter
And go along with you,
1'1 take you where the sugar cane grows
On the bank of the deep blue sea.
She went unto her little babe,
Of kisses she gave three,
Lie there, lie there, my sweet little babe
And keep your father's campany.
She went unto her golden store,
She dressed herself in green,
And as she walked the streets all around,
She looked like a lovely queen.
I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
I'm not weeping for my store,
I am weeping fo~ my sweet little babe
That I never shall see no more.
They had not gone but a week or two,
I'm sure not more than four,
Till her gallant ship by night did leak
And it sunk for to rise no more. .
May cursed be to all sea men,
May cursed be their life,
For they have been the ruin a:f a house carpenter
In persuading away his wife.
Don't never believe what a young man says,
Let his hair be dark or brown,
Unless he's on some high gallis drop
And say he would like to come down.
Don't never believe what a young girl says,
Let her hair be dark or brown,
For she'll tell you more lies than the starn in the

Although the English carol has not been recorded
before the eighteenth century, it is not likely to have been invented as such at so late a date; we may reasonably suppose medieval antecedents. It has at any rate been much
beloved in recent times and is the best known, probably, of traditional carols -- a distinction to which its tender charm well entitles it. ",Lee Skeens,Female Voice,"1.	 Joseph was a young man and a young aan was he
And he courted Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee.

2.	 Mary and Joseph was a-walking one day
Joseph	 spoke to Mary, there's ampl' o' cherry, cherries
enough to behold.

3.	 Mary spoke to Joseph so meek and so mild
Pray gather aecherries, Joseph, for I am with child.

4.	 Joseph flew in angry, in angry he flew
Joseph flew in angry, in angry he flew
Let the father of your baby gather- cherries for you.

5.	 Jesus cried and he spoke and these words he did say
Bow	 you low down, cherry tree:, let your mother have'
some.

6. The cherry tree bent way low down, low down to the
ground
And Mary gathered cherries while Joseph stood around.

7.	 Joseph took Mary all on his right knee
Cries, Oh Lord have aercy, what haven I a-done.

8.	 Joseph took Mary all on his left knee
Pray	 tell me, Little Baby, when your birthday shall
be'?
9.	 On the fifth day of January my birthday shall be
When the stars are all in the elements they done
tremble with fear.

The Lomaxes and others recorded numerous versions of this archetypal Mississippi prison song. “Rosie” was a generic name for a woman at Parchman Farm Penitentiary, and turns up in other prison songs recorded there. Nina Simone used the melody of “Rosie” for her 1965 recording of “Be My Husband”. A version by Leadbelly was adapted with new words by The Animals and retitled “Inside Looking Out.” It appeared as the B-side to The Animals’ eighth single, the first for Decca in 1966, and was produced by Tom Wilson after the band’s split from Mickie Most and EMI. Grand Funk Railroad also has had many versions of “Inside Looking Out” appear on both studio and live albums (Live Album (1970), Caught In The Act (1975), Live: The 1971 Tour).

No one can sing his songs without his permission. The presence of a Songman in a camp means social life, joy and, more deeply, being caught up in the traditions and life of the heroic past. The theme of the Gunborg is gossip. The Songman composes the words on some passing event in social heppenings such as in love affairs, but makes the allusions indirect, so as to avoid trouble. Moreover, the words frequently have a latent meaning, usually with sexual significance.The sample of which two verses are given, states that the Songman wanted his female cousin, and that they came out (from the camp).

Moreover, she grew up surrounded by a large, musically endowed community. It is a testament to Hall’s talent and character that, of all the African American singers recorded by the Lomax family, Alan Lomax featured her in The Rainbow Sign, which documents her life history. Using the pseudonym Nora  to present her oral history, Lomax described her vocal skill: “It is a liquid, full contralto, rich in low overtones; but it can leap directly into falsetto and play there as effortlessly as a bird in the wind.”

It is right and proper that this recording opens with “Another Man Done Gone.” The Lomaxes (father and son) selected it among their Best Loved American Folk Songs.  Located in the “work song” chapter of their Folk Songs of North America, this tune provides a furtive look at race relations in the South and the harsh reality of its penal system. The song also examines the subversive side of African American life. As Alan Lomax later indicated, “African Americans in the Deep South do not gossip freely with white men about such matters.” It speaks volumes about the Lomaxes (husband and wife) that Hall elected to sing it before them.",Vera Hall,Female Voice,"Another man done gone.
Another man done gone from the county farm.
Another man done gone.
I didn’t know his name.         (4x)

The early ballad seems apparently to have been revived when the piratical forays along the Algerian coast brought special meaning to the ""coast of Barbary"" in the late eighteenth century. The transmission to this country of a sea song was not unusual, but in this instance may have been stimulated by the fact that Stephen Decatur in 1815 decisively defeated Algerian pirates on the ""coast of the wild Barbaree."" The song was traditionally popular in the American navy and several texts have been recovered from Maine, where it was known to Mrs. Grover's father who sailed from Maine ports as a youth in the 19th century. ",Carrie Grover,Female Voice,"1. 	 Two lofty ships of Eng-e-Iand set sail,
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we,
And one was Prince of Luther and the
other Prince of Wales,
Cruising down round the coast of the wjld
Barbaree.
2. 	 ""Look ahead, look astern, look to wind'ard
and to lee,""
Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we, 
""There's a lofty ship astern and for us
she does make way,""

Barbaree.
3. ""Oh, hail her, oh, hail her,"" our gallant
captain cries,
""Are you a. man-a'-war or a privateer?""

""But 	I am a saucy pirate a-seeking for

name,
Of true and honest parents, raised in the state of

He was his father's only pride, his mother's only
joy, -- The pride of all the family was their wild colonial
boy.
At the early age of sixteen, Jack beGan his wild
career,
He seemed to know no danger, and of no one seemed
to fear.
He robbed the mail stac;e at Beach Ford, bade them
to go their way, -- With trembling hands they passed out their gold to
the wild colonial boy.
Jack wrote the judge a letter and told them to be
aware ,
Never to stop a poor boy from loafing 'round the
square,
And never to rob a mother of her pride and only joy,
Or else he'd go 'way plundering like the wild
colonial boy.
As Jack rode out one morning, as he merrilie rode
along,
A-listening to the mocking birds as they sang their
cheerful song,
He espied three mounted policemen: MacDavitt,
MacDavis and MacElvoyd,
Had been out hunting for the wild colonial boy.
""Surrender now, cried Davis, ""for you see there is
three to one!
""Surrender in the Queen's name, you outlawed plunderer's son. ""I'll fight but I won't surrender,"" cried the wild

Concerning a young riverman, so manly, true and brave,
'Twas on a jam on Gerry's Rock where he met hi s

'Twas on a Sunday morning, as you will quickly hear,
Our logs were piled up mountain high, we could not
keep them clear;
Then up stepped our young forema.n, said: 'Who'll
volunteer to go
And break the jam on Gerry's Rock with your foreman,
Young Monroe?""
Now some of them were willing, while others they were
not,
For to work on Sunday they did not think they'd ought,
But six of those bold rivermen did volunteer to go
And break the jam on Gerry's Rock with their foreman,
Yount; Nonroe.
Now they had not cleared off ma.ny logs when they
heard his clear voice say:
""I'd have you boys be on your guard, for the jam
will soon give way.~
These words he'd scarcely spoken when the jam did
break and go,
Takine with it six of these brave boys and their
foreman, Young Monroe.
Now, when these other shanty boys the sad news came
to hear,
They all pulled for the river, for Gerry's Rock did
steer,
Where six of those brave riverman a-floating down
did go,
While crushed and bleeding on the bank lay their
foreman, Young Monroe.
They lifted him from his watery grave, brushed back
his raven hair;
There was one fair form among them whose cries did
rend the air,
One fair form among them, a girl from Saginaw town,
Whose cries rose to the misty skies for her lover
who's gone down.
Fair Clara was the lady's name, the riverman's true
friend,
Who with her aged mother lived at the river's bend.
She was to wed youne Monroe some sunny day in May,

As she sailed upon the lowlands low,
As she sailed upon the lowland sea.
Then up stepped the cabin boy, a fine young man was he,
And he said: ""0 tell me, Captain, what will you give
to me .•. n
Yes he said, ''Now tell me, Captain, what will you give
to me
If I sink them in the lowlands low,
If I sink them in the lowland sea?""
""I have houses on dry land, a fine ship upon the sea;
Ny handsome, handsome daughter your wedded wife shall
be,
Yes, my 'handsome young daughter your wedded wife shall
be,
If you sink her in the lowlands low,
If you'll sink her in the lowland sea.""
Then he seized his auger and overboard jumped he,
He swam along the side of the Turkish Lovaree,
He bored her bright ship's bottom and he let the
water in,
And he sank her in the lowlands low,
And he sank her in the lowland sea.
Some of them were playing cards and some were throwing dice,
And some were standing 'round a-giving good advice,
Some were standing 'round, a-giving good advicl'i,
As she sailed in the lowlands low,
As she sailed in the lowland sea.
Then some with their hats and some with their caps
Were trying hard to stop up the salt-water gaps,
Were trying very hard to stop up all the gaps,
As she sailed upon the lowlands low
As she sailed in the _lowland sea.
(Mrs. Wells had ""As she sanlc into the lowlands •• ""
here)
He turned upon his face and back swam he,
Until he reached the side of the Golden Willow Tree,
He swam until he reached the Golden Willow Tree,
As she sailed upon the lowlands low,
As she sailed upon the lowland sea.
""Captain, my Captain, be as good as your word;
Now stop your handsome ship and take me back on board.
Please stop your handsome ship am take me back on
board,
For I've sunk them in the lowlands low,
For I've sunk them in the lowland sea. ""
""Oh no, I will' not be as good as my word,
A.s to stop my handsome ship and take you back on
board.
I'll not stop my handsome ship am take you back on
board,
Though you've sunk them in the lowlands low,
Though you've &unk them in the lowland sea.""
""Captain, cruel Captain, if it wasn't for your men,
I would bore your bright ship's bottom and I'd let
the water in.
I would bore your bright ship's bottom and I'd let
the water in,
And I'd sink you in the lowlands low,
And I'd sink you in the lowland sea."" 
Then he turned on his back am down sank he,
Saying nothing more to the Golden Willow Tree;
No he never said no more to the Golden Willow Tree,
As he sank into the lowlands low,
As he sank into the lowland sea.  ",,Sidney Robertson Cowell,1955,Smithsonian Folkways,"Wolf River Songs.
