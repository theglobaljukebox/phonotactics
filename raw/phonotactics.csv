Moreover, the words frequently have a latent meaning, usually with sexual significance.The sample of which two verses are given, states that the Songman wanted his female cousin, and that they came out (from the camp).

In his original notes, Danielou gives the background of the Ah¥r community as follows: “When the Aryans invaded India many centuries before Christ, the defeated people were allotted certain professions and thus were allowed to survive, maintaining their culture and religion to a great extent. The ancient and proud Abh¥r¢as, now called Ah¥rs, have thus been milkmen and cowherds for centuries and have kept alive forms of songs, dance, and epic poetry similar to those of many centuries ago.” Danielou was very attracted to the music of the Ah¥rs and produced an LP of their music in 1951 that was republished in 1984. 

The term virahå or birahå is now given to a broad classification of songs, while this form of virahå is more precisely known as kha®¥ birahå. This is a special style of song developed by the Ah¥r cowherders ostensibly to communicate with other herders and their distant villages while pasturing their animals. 

The antiquity of the Ah¥r community is corroborated by the fact that they are referred to (as ÅAbh¥ra cowherds) in the Råmåyaˆa and the Mahåbhårata epics dating from several centuries B.C.E. There is no way to establish the contention that they are pre-Aryans, especially as the texts of their kha®¥ birahås usually refer, as in this case, to the Aryan epic, Råmåyaˆa. Other references in their songs are evidently to their own myths, which could predate the Aryan invasions.","Nanku, Bachau, nagara ","Nanku; Bachau, Nagara",Unknown,"Danielou’s translation of the song text follows:

Chanted:
Aré! It is said—The horse named Mangaru was born in Maurapura City of king Alivå. O Father! But the Ahir was born in the bazar of Gaur¢a.

The style of performance suggests that it may be a form of Tamil ritual theater called Teruk ̈ttu (“street play”) also recently named “Ka†aik ̈ttu” (“story play”) since it is not played in a street, but in front of a temple. If so, however, it is not performed by a professional troupe which always uses a mukha v¥ˆå, a short, double - reed pipe along with other instruments. It is not uncommon for a particular style of Indian drama to be performed by communities of specialist performers who in the caste system have another hereditary occupation. For instance, the Vaˆˆå ̃ community of washermen who are one of the professional performing groups of Teruk ̈ttu. Danielou writes that the two songs given here are part of a drama composed and performed by fishermen in their own village.

Although Muslim invaders did bring new musical ideas and concepts from Iran, Turkey, and elsewhere in the Middle East, Qawwål¥ is a purely South Asian construct and has no parallel elsewhere. The word is said to be derived from the Arabic “Qaul”, meaning “dictum” or “saying,” but the genre has evolved a great deal from that concept. In its traditional context, qawwål¥ refers to Muslim religious, devotional, and mystical songs in praise of Allah, the Prophet, his descendants, and Muslim saints. The genre has extended to include, in the first place, ghazals — mystical love songs using the analogy of human love — and also a variety of other subjects, including Hindu religious themes. The traditional languages of qawwål¥ are Persian, Arabic, and Urdu, but many others are also used, including Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, and Sindhi. 

Qawwål¥ s are not laments, but are songs of love and devotion sung in ecstatic style. This qawwål¥ is somewhat unusual as it is an exhortation to a lay person to say his prayers. It uses Husain’s martyrdom during prayer as an example of the depth of concentration that the person praying should attempt to attain. Although it is about Husain’ s martyrdom, this would not be sung during Muharram, when only an elegy, mar≈siya (or a stanza of which, called soz) is sung, using only vocal drones and no instruments. This qawwål¥ would be sung in mehfil (gatherings) particularly at shrines.","Muhammad Usman, Raza, Saukat Ali, with Rahamat Ullah, dholak, Raza, small Indian harmonium","Male Voices; Dholak; Raza, Small Indian Harmonium",Men,"The text and translation of this qawwål¥ follows:

If you seek to see [the light] then bow your head in prayer
If your heart experienced the light then you felt the ecstasy of prayer
Distance your heart from egotism put yourself into prayer
Then you will see the light of God in prayer
But first, like Husain [be prepared to] have your head cut off in prayer
The darling of ‘Ali [ i.e., Husain] never left his prayer
The terrible dagger was drawn but he kept on praying
Look at his prayer who will pray like that?
That is how the devout should pray as Husain prays
Once his head bowed in prayer it did not rise up from the prayer
Having called him as a guest [Shimr] honored his guest a great deal!
Though the river flowed nearby there was not a drop to drink
See the tyranny of this man He twirled his knife against Husain’s neck

The Bauls belong to a syncretic mystic cult of wandering mendicants in Bengal and Bangladesh. Their ideas are influenced by Vaishnava Hinduism and Sufi Islam as well as by Tantric Buddhism. Perhaps because of their unconventional beliefs, the word baul is said to mean “one who is crazy.” There are many cults of wandering musicians in India, all with their own philosophical and mystical underpinnings that are reflected in their unique lifestyles, clothing, songs and even the instruments they use. Bauls frequently travel alone and although accompaniment on the dotåra (lit. “two - stringed” but often having four strings, as in this instance) is not unusual, they more often accompany themselves on khamak (a variable - tension chordophone that may often described as a plucked drum) or ektårå (monochord) and simultaneously play a small drum (∂ugg¥) as they sing and dance. In recent times they have achieved international recognition, and Baul performers have toured widely, and their ensembles now often include instruments such as the harmonium and khol (double conical drum) as well as small cym bals and clappers.","Haripada Devanath, accompanying himself on dotar",Male Voice; Dotar,Men,"The translation of the Baul song as given by Danielou is as follows:

his own craft.
Unaware of the current
You start the voyage to the other shore.

Taking the wealth you received from the Great Lord, you 
started your trip on the ocean of lust.

The words of Eros murmured by the striking waves 
will break your craft 
and nothing will be left.

The mind’s helmsman cannot at his fancy guide his own craft.
Make the door of prayer the way to salvation.
Hold your boat with the divine name
Do not try for the shore which lust suggests
And you will fear no storm or tempest.

The mind’s helsman cannot at his fancy guide his own craft.

But the mad helmsman is not ready [to hear].
It starts across in the storm and wind

Groups of wandering mendicants who travel from one shrine to another singing devotional songs (bhajans) are found to this day. This is rather an unusual ensemble of wandering ascetics, principally because the stringed instrument identified in the title as an ekatårå, a drone instrument, actually appears to be a fretted sitar, as can be heard on the record and seen in the photograph. A sitår with its many strings is normally much too delicate an instrument to be carted around from village to village, especially in the heat of Rajasthan, while a spiked lute ektår¢a that plays only a drone is much more usual. The musicians are probably not monks, but novices training to become ordained at some shrine or and other where they generally will return once a year.","Mahadeva giri, Munna giri, group of companions, chang, ekatara, karatala",Male Voices; Chang; Ekatara; Karatala,Men,"The following translation is by Danielou:

In his hair the Ganges plays,
And seated on his lap,
The White-Goddess* caresses him.

Holding in his hand the garland of skulls,
Day and night he drinks the cup of poison [hashish],
His drum roaring “dama, dama”

And seated on his lap,
The White-Goddess caresses him.

Wearing at his waist the skin of a beast,
A scorpion tied as an armlet,
This merciless youth spends his life,

And seated on his lap,
The White-Goddess caresses him.

Singing the virtues of the Teacher
And counting hardships
Shall be your daily consolation,
Meditating on the Mountain’s Goddess,

And seated on his lap,
The White Goddess caresses him.

Kathaka≥i is rooted in the temple genre of Kerala known as K¨†iyå††am, India’s only surviving traditional Sanskrit theater form, whose history goes back over 1500 years. In reaction to disturbances caused by the Portuguese occupation of the Kerala coast, a bhakti (Hindu devotional) movement arose in sixteenth century Kerala. This in turn gave rise to the creation of vernacular literary texts, including several plays written in south Kerala in the late sixteenth century based on religious stories from the Råmåyaˆa epic. This form, known as Råmanå††am (“Råma drama”), gradually evolved and was renamed Kathaka¬i (“story play”) in the 18th century, when new plays were written and performed based on the Mahåbhårata epic. The author of these plays was a prince of north Kerala who greatly expanded the depth of expression (bhåva) and characterization, developed the use of numerous rågas and tålas for their emotional impact, and enhanced the costuming, makeup and staging. Today’s highly sophisticated and virtuosic Kathaka¬i is performed by male musicians and actors whose lives are dedicated to perfecting their art.

This extract presents the mythological king DakΩa, the embodiment of creative power, competence, and intelligence born of Brahma himself. He is said to have had a vast number of daughters, including Sati, who eventually committed suicide because of a disagreement between her father and her husband, Íiva. In this kathaka¬i play, the playwright offers a psychological explanation for the family tensions that led to Sati’s suicide by fire; her father’s contempt and derision because of her devotion to Lord Íiva.

In this extract, the four percussionists first play a prelude in six beats, which serves as entrance music for the actor. The lead singer then sings DakΩa’s lines, accusing Sati of sin and impurity, and expelling her from his sacrificial hall. His lines are aggressively set to the bold contours of a pentatonic råga called Såra∫ga, which does not resemble the Såra∫ga of either North or South Indian classical music but uses the following five notes and is similar to the South Indian råga Mohanam:
                        
C   D   E   G   A   c

 This is performed in a medium-tempo seven beat cycle called Tripu†a:
Claps:                     X              O
                1    2    3    4    5    6    7
Drum syllables:     ta   ki   †a   ta   ka   di   mi

The actor meanwhile mimes the text. The first line is repeated to allow the actor to execute variations in his facial expressions and gestures. The percussionists then play an interlude for the actor to execute additional movements. Then two half-lines are sung, after each of which one or two accompanying voice(s) join in repetitions, concluding with the repetition of the opening line. The percussionists intervene with a second interlude, until the voice for the female character Sati mournfully emerges, accompanied in muted strokes in a slow seven-beat cycle. She warns her father that his opposition to Lord Shiva, to whom she is devoted, will bring on his wrath. Sati’s pathetic plea is aptly set to Punnagavarå¬¥ råga with its languorous ornaments and minor intervals:

                        C    Db    Eb    F    G    Ab    Bb    c

The third degree (E) is, however, extremely low and actually sounds only a half step above the lowered second degree, as in some South Indian classical rågas. Each line is repeated except the final fourth line, which is interrupted by a percussion interlude heralding DakΩa’s furious response in rapid seven-beat cycles of Muri a†aˆ†a tå¬a (similar to Tripu†a tåla, but faster), set to Kedåragau¬a råga with its pentatonic ascent and heptatonic descent:

        C    D    F    G    Bb    c              c    Bb    A    G    F    E    D    C

After he repeats two lines threatening to call his slaves to oust Sati, the percussionists accelerate the tempo for his climactic dance of rage.",Orchestra of the dancer Gopinath,Orchestra,,,,Alain Daniélou,1952,Columbia Records,Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music: India.

The Lomaxes and others recorded numerous versions of this archetypal Mississippi prison song. “Rosie” was a generic name for a woman at Parchman Farm Penitentiary, and turns up in other prison songs recorded there. Nina Simone used the melody of “Rosie” for her 1965 recording of “Be My Husband”. A version by Leadbelly was adapted with new words by The Animals and retitled “Inside Looking Out.” It appeared as the B-side to The Animals’ eighth single, the first for Decca in 1966, and was produced by Tom Wilson after the band’s split from Mickie Most and EMI. Grand Funk Railroad also has had many versions of “Inside Looking Out” appear on both studio and live albums (Live Album (1970), Caught In The Act (1975), Live: The 1971 Tour).

An agrarian landscape, the songs were song by men working in the fields, who also gathered in formalized singing groups. The style is characterized by the prominent role of bass-drone singers. Singing typical of northern Liguria.

Ceriana’s polyphonic singing typically features two solo voices — two tenors of differing vocal timbres — called the primo and the secondo. Generally, the secondo initiates the singing and the primo sings over his voice, each singer contributing his own particular ornamentation. The soloists’ clear, frequently fragmented melodic line contrasts with the dark, melodic immobility of the bass- drone singers, who support the soloists by singing the words on a single note, recalling a the drone of a bagpipe. At the conclusion of a phrase, some of the basses descend to the tonic. Interestingly, the townspeople refer to this style of drone singing as basso continuo. This particular performance is rendered more complex by the presence of an intermediate voice between the basses and the secondo part. The narrative ballad performed here, “A figlia du capitanu,” is one that was not included in Costantino Nigra’s famous 1888 collection.",Compagnia Sacco: male chorus,Male Voices,Men,"De chi l’è sta bèla figlia

This is undoubtedly the most popular song for dancing in Valle d’Aosta. The words, in Provençal, were probably adapted to a preexisting melody, perhaps a ronde or farandole in 6/8 time and spanning the interval of a sixth, whose simplicity facilitated memorization, and hence wide distribution. The same motif occurs in another song from the Piedmontese valleys bordering France “En passant le Mont-Cenis, vient de la neige” (“Crossing Mount Cenis [on the border between Piedmont and France], it snows”). The tune resembles “La Marion sur un pommier” (“Marion in an Apple Tree,” a typical Savoyard song, according to Julien Tiersot).","Pacifico Perret, Giuseppe Gérard, accordions, tamborine, mixed chorus",Male Voice; Accordions; Tamborine; Mixed Voices,Mixed adults,"Dansa pa deussù lo fèn

The Ritrovo dei facchini was a meeting place for ship’s colliers and longshoremen of the Port of Genoa. This trallalero is considered a classic of the authentic repertoire and is also one of the most difficult, above all for the great vocal range required of the tenore and the falsetto. It is thought that the mention of “Parigi” (Paris) may not refer to the French capital but rather to a ship by that name. “Parigi” may also be a corruption of Paraggi, a village not far from Portofino, where there was a community of coral fishers.

Although many songs in this category have an African flavor, others clearly draw on European traditions. The British Caribbean in particular is known as a rich repository for old sea chanteys. This launching song from Carriacou appears to be derived in part from one such chantey, known to collectors as “A Long Time Ago” or “In ’Frisco Bay.” This chantey, which was very popular on English and American ships during the nineteenth century, was originally a halyard song, used for hoisting or lowering sails. In Carriacou, however, it is used for very different purposes, such as launching schooners or honoring deceased sailors at wakes. 

Whereas many versions of “A Long Time Ago” make mention of ’Frisco Bay, this one refers to “Mobile Bay,” which would seem to lend support to those who have argued that West Indian workers and sailors played a major role in the development of British and American chanteying. (Mobile, Alabama, was an important cotton-trading center and one of the bustling American seaports where West Indian sailors and those from other nations met, caroused, and exchanged songs during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.)  

Although the singing style of the launching song heard here resembles that of British or American chanteymen, Carriacouan sailors use the song to honor the spirits of deceased friends and relatives, thus investing it with a new meaning that faithfully reflects the religious concepts of their African ancestors.","Willie Alexander, Sonnel Allert, Clyde Anjou, Charles Bristol, Canute Caliste, Lenus George, Conrad Joseph, Gorine Joseph, Kingston Joseph, Matteson Joseph, Newton Joseph, Sidney Joseph, Alan Lomax, Avoide Sylvester.

Despite a general lack of exposure to North Indian classical music, generations of Indo-Caribbean musicians, drawing on their fragmentary knowledge and their own innovative spirit, cultivated a “local classical” genre that came to be known as tan singing. Sung at weddings and other functions, tan singing evolved into a unique idiom, with thoroughly idiosyncratic versions of North Indian classical and semiclassical genres like dhrupad, ghazal, and especially thumri, heard here. 

Trinidadian thumri bears little resemblance to its North Indian counterpart: it is distinguished primarily by its sequential rhythmic structure. This includes a curious metrical modulation during the initial sections, in which the downbeat shifts by one beat between the refrain and verse passages, before accelerating in an extendedbarhti  (in India, laggi ) section. As is standard, the singer here doubles his vocal line on harmonium, while being accompanied by dholak and dantal, a steel rod struck with a U-shaped clapper. Although in severe decline in Guyana and Suriname, tan singing is still relatively vital in Trinidad.

The text to this song, as in most tan singing, is drawn from published verse anthologies obtained from India. This verse contains the pen name of the mystical poet Kabir (1440—1518), perhaps a misattribution.","Heeralal Boodhai, Harmonium; Ramnanan Lokhai, Drums; Dindial Maharaj; Ramdial, Kharangee; Samaroo, Violin; Seebalack, Dhantal","Male Voices; Harmonium, Drums; Violin; Dhantal",Men,". . . kahe Kabir faqir pukar jhutiya beohar,

It has remained extremely popular in the Caribbean despite the decline of the Hindi language. It is generally performed by groups of male amateur singers, primarily during the springtime festival of phagwa, which celebrates the amorous dalliances of Krishna, the playful and mischievous cowherd deity.

The singers repeat one line in a set of stock melodies and rhythms, starting out with a seven-beat meter and modulating to a thunderous climax in duple meter, which then returns to the first tempo. 

The text to this verse praises Lord Rama and celebrates the examples of Mirabai, Sugrim, Bhibhushan, and other legendary figures who achieved spiritual salvation or worldly success through their devotion to Rama.","Ramnarine Bholai, Ramroop Bholai, Sitaram Bholai, Ramnanan Boochoon, Heeralal Boodhai, Gowkaren, Bhola Hansa, Ramnath Harripersad, Bisnath Jhingoo, Phoolchan Koongbeharry, Pandit Benny Madho, Mohase Mahabir, Dindial Maharaj, Kisoon Maharaj, Ratanlal Manbodh, Raghoonath Ramdass, Ramnath Ramdass, Seebalack, dholak, ghang",19 Male Voices,Men,"Tero bigre bat ban jae Ram bhajo bhae [. . .]

Today their descendants, often referred to as “East Indians,” are scattered across the region; in a few countries, such as Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago, they constitute a majority or near-majority of the population. In each of these places, distinct Indian musical traditions, both Hindu and Muslim, have survived, forming an important part of the local cultural heritage. In Trinidad, certain local Indian musical genres such as chutney  and tassa  drumming have made significant contributions to urban popular music, spawning new Indo-Caribbean blends such as chutney soca.

In areas with large concentrations of Indians, such as the village of Penal, Trinidad, where this recording was made, Indian “folk” musical genres such as chowtal  continue to be performed alongside “classical” musics such as thumri  and Hindi-language devotional songs known as bhajans. According to the leader of this group as interviewed on tape by Lomax, this selection is a chaupai, or Hindu holy prayer, traditionally sung in January, when the annual custom of bathing in the sacred river Ganges is observed by Indian sages and others. In poetic language, the sung prayer recounts episodes in the life of the Lord Rama.  In his notes Lomax wrote with particular enthusiasm of his own participation in the session in which this recording was made: 

The group sat cross-legged in a circle on the floor of the school pavilion. The leader had a great volume of the Ramayana open before him on a reading stand. To his left were two drummers. All singers had brass cymbals held loosely in the palms of their hands by leather thongs attached to wooden handles. They clashed them against each other, following the rhythm of the lead or the drum. I joined the circle after a time and entered an entirely new world. Suddenly I had joined a circle of equals. . . . The faces of my singing mates were full of joy and power, independence and beauty. They opened their throats and their hearts opened at the same time. We all chanted and clashed exactly together, as a group of equal males sweeping us into wave after wave of accelerated tempo. . . . I have never felt so welcome, so much at home in a group.","Phoolchan Koongbeharry, male chorus, dholak, ghang",Male Voice; Male Voices; Dholak; Ghang,Men,,,Alan Lomax,1962,ACE Online Archive 2012,"Caribbean Recordings, ACE Online Archive","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress",,

Polyphonic singing in western Liguria is not dissimilar to the Trallalero of the port of Genoa.

This is one of the finest and most interesting of Alan Lomax’s Ceriana recordings, not only because of the splendid performance but also because this song is performed very differently today. Its melodic outline and use of the minor mode limit the opportunity for the basses to come in; thus the performance takes on the quality of soloists with accompanying support instead of choral polyphony. Under its better-known title, “La guerriera”, this song is widespread in northern Italy and in other European countries.

It was sung in accompaniment to the Festival of La Barca, described in the introduction and track 18. Although this particular song is still remembered, it is no longer often sung in full today, probably because of the difficulty of remembering the concatenations of the verses, which get longer and longer as the song progresses. It occurs elsewhere: A version with a different melody was collected in Cesnola, (Piemonte), and another in the area of Briga, not far from Baiardo. The beginning of the melody of the “Canto dell’albero” resembles the beginning of the second part of the “Canto della Barca”, suggesting a common origin for the two songs. 

The ceremony involves cutting a tall tree from the nearby woods and transporting it (formerly by an oxcart, today by truck) to the church square, where it is hoisted by means of musclepower. There is a place for it in the piazza where there is a hole, which is kept covered during the rest of the year. The top of the tree, previously cut off, is set into this hole — a practice symbolizing procreation. This formerly took place in the morning when people were on their way to Mass. Nowadays it takes place in the afternoon for the benefit of crowds of tourists. The few who still recall the song intone it while holding hands and circling slowly around the tree.

The singers of the Compagnia Sacco try to give the fullest possible version of this song, which is still in their repertoire today. It’s a vain attempt, for the simple reason that the song doesn’t really belong to the narrative genre but rather to that of the single-strophe lyrical love song, as evident from its eleven-syllable meter. The verses are arranged to form quatrains or sestinas, each complete in itself. The rather aggressive beginning — What have you gone and said, serpent tongue?” [i.e., deceiving to self and others)] that we hear in this recording today has been replaced by the more innocuous, “Where do you come from, serpent tongue?” ","Compagnia Sacco, male chorus",Male Voices,Men,"Co ti èi andaita a di o lenga serpentina

Like the heroine from Baiardo in “Ninetta”, Pinotta in Ceriana straightforwardly lets her fiancé into her bedroom, without playing him any tricks, as happens in other versions of “Convegno notturno”. In this version, moreover, after a clumsy attempt to pass him off as the miller who had come to grind the grain (a common metaphor for sexual intercourse), Pinotta confesses to her mother about having received him, something that lady already knew anyway, since she was in cahoots with her daughter from the first.","Compagnia Sacco, male chorus",Male Voices,Men,"O Pinota bèlla Pinota

The song is but one in a series of Trinidadian calypsos that stereotypically portray Hispanic women as passionate lovers. When arranging to record Tiger in 1962, Lomax, quite fittingly, decided to put the great calypsonian together with a string band made up of traditional parang musicians. The session resulted in a splendid old-time, Venezuelan-tinged sound that nicely complemented Tiger’s overall style, but went especially well with the lyrics of “SeÒorita Panchita.” (Neville Marcano is also featured on Growling Tiger in the Portraits series of The Alan Lomax Collection on Rounder Records.)","Neville Marcano, known as Growling Tiger, Eugene Brito, Ralph Charles, Robert Charles, Paul Gervais, Samuel Mira, Vivian Moses, Randolph Phipps, Emmanuel Williamsfiddle, flute, 2 guitars, cuatro, bass, chac-chac",Male Voice; 8 Male Voices; Fiddle; Flute; 2 Guitars; Cuatro; Bass; Chac-Chac,Men,"SeÒorita Panchita,

This is a ""single tone"" calypso, or one in which the verses have four lines.  ""Indian Prince"" was a Trinidadian Hindu named Robert Haytasingh (Hindus comprise approximately half of Trinidad's population).  As is customary, all three proclaim their musical superiority.  Tiger and Iere mix in references to the arms and space race, while the Prince is more nationalistic, including a reference to then Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru (1889-1964).  Tiger's opening verse echo's one by legendary first generation calypsonian William ""The Conqueror"" Pastee, one of the first calypsonians he heard as a boy:

They may walk by day
They may walk by night
Tell them I bring King Fanto with me
So the devil and the angel can't trouble me 

According to Tiger's biographer, Rawle Gibbons, this song was an early favorite of young Neville Marcano in the 1920's.

I'm sure Mr.
Nehru 'll be glad to know,
In Trinidad we got Indian calypso,
And he must really understand,
We live with the harmony,
we live with the charms.

Tiger:
I mean,
I don't want to criticize,
But of course,
this age is too civilize—
To prepare A-bomb to destroy humanity,
It's a shame and disgrace to humanity!

Indian Prince:
Blow the bugle and sound the drum,
Tell them Indian Prince come,
Tiger take it easily,
Tonight you expose to bad destiny.

Lord Iere:
Prince you are making fun,
We are speaking about the atomic bomb,
Because we want to live in peace an' unity,
So let us live in tranquillity.

Tiger:
I don't want to fight,
I don't want to war,
I want some food to eat,
I want to eat more,
Want to live fine, [...] luxury and peace,
With peace and tranquillity.

Indian Prince:
Now it amazing to hear me fall,
When the bugle blow and the trumpet call,
Even the skeletons into hell,
With the Prince they try to rebel.

Lord Iere:
Prince, I really understand,
It seems to me as you a true-born Russian,
But you'll agree with me
If you tamper with me—like a mapepire.

Tiger:
England and France and the USA,
This is time to help us out any day,
They have the ability,
I know they are fine,
Why we can't live as we all humankind?

Indian Prince:
Before Tiger and the Iere come to me,
They should at least go back and learn their ABC,
I know them and they real can feel,
They [didn't] face me like in an open field.

Lord Iere:
Tiger, place your hand in mine,
Never, never, never, treat you unkind,
Prince, you should really know,
We both are the genius of calypso.

Tiger:
And they can come by day,
If they come by night,
They can bring the atomic bomb,
Never, never we intend to run.
They may come by day,
Come by night,
They can bring the atomic bomb,
Never, never we going to run.",,Alan Lomax,1962,ACE Online Archive 2012,"Caribbean Recordings, ACE Online Archive","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress",,

Often this was the task of the young men and women together. In the green meadows and during the bright days of the Alpine summer, were made the marriages of these independent people. 

One day along a road in the French-speaking Valle d’Aosta, I recorded the beginning of this ancient summer pilgrimage. The herd of cows was moving along the road of social precedence. At the head stepped the most productive milker in the herd, at her throat the biggest of the bronze bells and between her horns a high garland of flowers and shining ornaments. A few paces behind came her three court attendants with somewhat smaller bells and less lavish crowns. Then came small garlands and bells of middle tone and after them, the ruck of heifers with little bells ringing. With no other central plan than the stately rhythm of the walkers, this whole orchestra of bells, swinging against the bovine dewlaps, weaves a heterophony that far outdoes the calculations of Cage and Bortolotto. — Alan Lomax",Bells on cattle,Cattle Bells,,,,Alan Lomax,1954,Smithsonian Folkways,"Italian Folk Music, Vol 1: Piedmont, Emelia, Lombardy.

They play with a singing tone, a loose and vibrant rhythm, and a confidence in themselves as an orchestra which marks an old and sure tradition. Village bands playing in this style can be found in Central Europe all the way east into Central Russia, but I myself have heard no performance more surefooted and charming than that of rural Piedmont. —Alan Lomax

The monferrina is one of the best known dances of northern Italy and the one most associated with old Piedmont. The hilly region between the Po River and the Apennine mountains of Liguria and Piedmont was known historically as Monferrato and was subdivided into lower Monferrato (between the Tanaro and Po rivers) and upper Monferrato (south of the Tanaro). Renowned for grape-growing, the region also produced a rich folk culture of songs and dances associated with the agricultural round, above all with the grape harvest and with taverns. Here is a classic example in both text and tune of this traditional circle dance. The first section in 2/4 time accompanies the spasso, in which couples walk arm and arm with a jumping step while singing; the second part in 6/8 time is the balletto, in which the dancers face each other. 

Tonco, in Asti, is celebrated for its Festival of the Pitu (turkey), held in the piazza on the last Sunday of Carnival, during which young men on horseback compete to see who can detach the head of the pitu hung from a rope on a pole in the piazza. The turkey is a symbolic sacrifice whose burlesque last will and testament in dialect rhymes is read during the festivities.  

La Bersagliera di Tonco is one of the oldest bands in Piedmont and is still active today. It was founded in 1894 by Pietro Stobbione, a baker, and Giuseppe Cantino, a postal supervisor, both clarinetists. By 1900, the band had 16 members, thanks to the sponsorship of the district physician, Luigi Ferrando. In 1901, it was decreed by statute that the players should wear the uniform of the Bersaglieri. When its personnel reached 36, La Bersagliera split into a band and an orchestra and after World War I, it became quite well known throughout Italy. Currently, it has about 30 members. Its present director, trumpeter Bruno Bezzo, is the author of many arrangements and was present in 1954 when these recordings were made.","La Bersagliera band: Bruno Bezzo (trumpet), Camillo Spina (trombone), Luigi Ragazzi (trombone), Felice Sampietro (clarinet), Enrico Velio (tuba); with Dante Stobbione (violin), Giuseppe Maffei (accordion), Adriana Allara, Vittorina Allara, Gemma Meda, Giuliana Meda (female voices), and a mixed chorus",Mixed Voices; Trombones; Clarinet; Double Bass; Violin; Accordion,Mixed adults,"O bundì bundì bundì

While John A. continued to mine the rich vein of prison song, Alan, working independently, recorded in the free world until he returned to Mississippi’s notorious Parchman Penitentiary in 1948. He brought with him a tape recorder, a brand new technology at the time. He felt that the prison work song tradition was in decline but was pleased to find some singers like Tangle Eye who still carried it on. The song heard here is a “holler” on the theme of prison life and longing for freedom. Songs like this were used to accompany solitary agricultural labor, such as plowing, and could also be heard outside the prisons. With the addition of an instrument, such as a guitar, they formed the bulk of the vocal raw material of the blues. Similar hollers were sung in Africa and other African-American societies for other solitary tasks such as herding cattle.

This final “lowdown” blues by Sonny Terry is about a woman with a heart “like a piece of railroad steel.” Terry handles the blues structure rather informally here, and performs with his usual verve. His falsetto vocal helps to obscure and mitigate the violent sentiments that permeate this song.

Alan Lomax first met Sonny Terry (born Sanders Terrell; 1911–1986) at the “From Spirituals to Swing” concert held at Carnegie Hall in 1938 and organized by the journalist, promoter, and record producer John Hammond. At this time Terry was working with a group of street performers based in Durham, North Carolina, and made the journey to New York City with one of these compatriots, Bull City Red. In Durham and on record, Sonny and Bull City Red played regularly with the popular singer-guitarist Blind Boy Fuller, who died in 1941. Terry first appeared in concert with the man who would become his longtime partner, Brownie McGhee, at a production hosted by Paul Robeson in Washington D.C. in 1942. Following this opportunity, he, McGhee, and Lead Belly (whom they met at the same event) recorded for Alan Lomax at the Library of Congress. It was through the encouragement of Lomax that Sonny eventually moved north to New York City where he became a highly popular blues artist. “Worried Blues” features the distinctive falset-to vocals and superlative harmonica playing that were the hallmarks of his individual performances in this period.

James’ guitar style and vocals were in the tradition of his hometown of Bentonia, Mississippi (compare Jack Owens’ version of “Cherry Ball Blues” in this collection); he also recorded outstanding piano blues. The eerie high-pitched vocals accompanied by distinctive guitar or piano patterns in his early recordings create a lasting impression of musical originality and reflective sadness that mark him as a prominent musician. In the excitement of “discovery” that infused a coterie of United States folk music enthusiasts in the early 1960s, James was “found” in 1964 and began a second career as a blues performer. “Cherry Ball Blues” is a title James first recorded in 1931; Alan Lomax obtained this version at the Newport Folk Festival in 1966.

By his mid-teens, it appears, he became a pianist in barrelhouses on Rampart Street and in similar locations where he was exposed to the traditional repertoire of the city’s tenderloin district. The lyrics for “I Hate a Man Like You” were written from the point of view of a woman. The New Orleans singer Lizzie Miles was first to record this Morton piece for Victor in 1929, with the composer accompanying on the piano. Blues and barrelhouse piano music was but one aspect of Morton’s extensive repertoire, exemplified by his career as a significant jazz bandleader.

Williamson explained that he had composed this song while working in a levee camp, and, although the first verse certainly has work-camp origins, it is probably derived from “Black Name Moan,” a very authentic levee camp song Bessie Tucker recorded for the Victor Company in 1928. The “line” referred to is the work line, or the line of the levee itself. In Sonny Boy’s version (which he first recorded for Bluebird in 1941) his theme is unrequited love, supplemented by a spoken interjection expressing nostalgia for the South; in the instance of this 1947 recording, his native Tennessee. One of the most influential and popular blues harmonica players to have recorded, Williamson was based in Chicago, Illinois, from the early 1940s until he was brutally murdered there in 1948. John Cowley, Ph.D.

Big Bill:  And uh, the thing has come to showdown, and we really want to know why, and how come a man have the blues. I worked on levee camps, extra gangs, road camps, rock camps, and rock quarries and every place, and I hear guys singin' un-hmm, un-hmm this and mmmm that, and uh, I want to know and I want to get the thing plainly that the blues is something that’s from the heart — I know that. And whensoever you hear a fellow singing the blues, I always believed it was really a heart thing, from his heart, you know, and is expressing his feeling about how he felt to the people — and that's the only way he know to say those things. I've known guys that wanted to cuss out the boss and he was afraid to go up to his face and tell him what he wanted to tell him, and I've heard them sing those things — sing words, you know — back to the boss, just be behind the wagon, hookin' up the horses or somethin' or 'nuther — or the mules or something. And then he'd go to work and go to singin' and say things to the horse, you know, horse — make like the mule stepped on his foot — say, ""Get off my foot, goddam it!"" or something like that, you know, and he meant he was talkin' to the boss. ""You son of a bitch, you.” Say, ""You got no business on my … stay off my foot!"" and such things as that — that's the point.

The African-American community of semi-rural Hughes was large enough to support two small juke bands that performed scintillating versions of old-time and more recent blues hits coupled with the occasional original composition. “Dimples In Your Jaws,” played here by a group led by the singer-guitarist Joe Lee (real name Willie Jones, b. 1929), is a version of a John Lee Hooker hit that the Detroit-based Mississippian recorded for Vee-Jay in 1956. Sometimes one of the hazards of fieldwork is the fast pace of events that takes place during a recording session. It was under these circumstances that Alan credited “Forrest City” Joe (Joe B. Pugh, 1926–1960; leader of Hughes’ other juke band) as the harmonica player and “Boy Blue” (Roland Hayes) as the drummer in this performance.

During the recording session, Alan Lomax carefully interviewed David Edwards and ascertained that he came from a musical family; Henry Edwards, David’s fiddle- and guitar-playing father, bought  David his first guitar and taught him to play it. Henry performed “old time and blues” and learned his style in “south Mississippi.” He apparently gave up playing when David was of age to become a professional musician. “The Army Blues,” on which Edwards expertly plays both guitar and harmonica, expresses David’s concern that he might be drafted into the armed forces fighting World War II. He had made up the song three weeks or so prior to the recording session and although, naturally, not anxious “to go,” he expresses his preparedness if called upon to do so. Edwards especially impressed Lomax: “He’s a man who’s been all over the country, he’s a very experienced musician, same age as I am, twenty-seven years old, and he’s studied under the best guitar players in the country and he really knows how...” John Cowley, Ph.D.","David “Honeyboy” Edwards, vocal, harmonica, guitar","Male Voice, Harmonica, Guitar",Men,"Uncle Sam need no women, but he sure can take your men

He learned it from Doug Suggs, a sharp* on the piano from Saint Louis, about five years ago?” which was affirmed by Ammons. Demonstrating one of his techniques in encouraging high-quality performances, Lomax continued, “He says that he can’t bat it out like Doug, but I believe Albert can.” Albert Ammons (1907-1949) was an exemplary Chicago-school blues and boogie pianist whose greatest influence was the Texas-born prodigy Hersel Thomas. The origins of both Suggs and Thomas indicate some of the diverse influences absorbed by blues pianists in the Windy City. Ammons was another of the pianists whom John Hammond featured in his 1938 “From Spirituals to Swing” concert at Carnegie Hall. Alan Lomax was especially proud to have secured these recordings, noting in the 1939 “Report of the Librarian of Congress” that they “represent the very finest performances of these Negro folk-artists.” John Cowley, Ph.

Handy, the composer who is regarded as the  “Father of the Blues,” heard the “long chain man” version of “Joe Turner Blues” in the 1890s. He  adapted the piece for sheet music publication in 1915, telling the folklorist Dorothy Scarborough several years later that he “did away with the prison theme and played up a love element, so that Joe Turner became, not the dreaded sheriff, but the absent lover” (1923). While the rendering of “Joe Turner” that Alan Lomax obtained from the Pratcher brothers’ string band in 1959 does not use Handy’s lyrics, their version nevertheless is about a departed lover—in this instance, a woman rather than the missing male of the Handy verses. This transfer of meaning and motivation serves as a good example of the complex mix of oral/non-oral processes  involved in the dissemination of folk music. The change of emphasis does not appear to be related to  the performers’ generation (Bob Pratcher, 1892–1964; Miles Pratcher, 1895 1964) and probably reflects a functional development for dancing. The Pratchers’ engaging style, once a mainstay of black country dances, was almost extinct by the time Lomax recorded them. Only a few examples of this variety were documented subsequently.

Parker’s tune was inspired by John Lee Hooker’s 1949 hit “Boogie Chillen,” which supplied the title for this selection.

His terrain extended to the Mississippi River and the earliest reports of the song were collected in Mississippi, between 1905 and 1909. These versions express the widespread fear of Turner as the “long chain man;” this recording, from the Mississippi fife player Ed Young (1908-1974), represents one of these forms of the song. The performance is a product of one of Lomax’s experiments to create the sound of pre Revolutionary African-American music, with the white Virginian Hobart Smith accompanying Young on a handmade, wooden fretless four-string banjo. Turner’s reputation as a “bad man” had extended to the Appalachians, as witnessed by Smith’s interjection to this effect.

A tall man, he took the sobriquet Memphis Slim and began a career as a barrelhouse pianist in the early 1930s. After hoboing through the south, working in juke joints, dance halls, and work camps, he arrived in Chicago, Illinois, in 1937 and began a recording career there in the early 1940s as an accompanist, solo performer, and a band-leader. He played with the principal blues artists of the period, including John Lee “Sonny Boy” Williamson and Big Bill Broonzy, whom he accompanied to New York for Alan Lomax’s “Midnight Special: Honky Tonk Blues at Midnight” concert at Town Hall on March 1, 1947. Elated by the success of the performance, Lomax took the threesome the following day to the Decca recording studio, where he had arranged to record an extended interview with them. “I put my little one-celled Presto disc recorder on the floor,” Lomax recalled, “and I sat at their feet, flipping the discs. There was only one microphone. We had a couple of drinks.” The first performance recorded was Slim’s philosophical “Life Is Like That” and then the interview commenced, resulting in the celebrated documentary presentation, Blues in the Mississippi Night. Memphis Slim died in Paris, France, in 1988.
John Cowley, Ph.D.

In 1947, using his own Presto disc recording machine, Alan Lomax recorded bluesmen Big Bill Broonzy (1893-1958), Memphis Slim (1915-1988), and Sonny Boy Williamson (1914-1948) at Decca Studios in New York City, after they had given a concert at Town Hall. In a session of candid oral history and song, the three artists explain the origin and nature of the blues. Memphis Slim describes writing the song during a difficult period during the previous year, when he couldn't find a place to live or afford his rent.

Big Bill Broonzy: Well, some people say that the blues is a cow wanta see her calf, but I don't say it like that. I say it's a man that's got a companion, and she turn him down, and things like that happens, you know — and that's where I gets the blues from — when I wanta see my baby and wanta see her bad, and something happens, I can’t find her — and that gives me the blues. So what do you think about it, boy? You got something to say about the reason why you have the blues?

Sonny Boy Williamson: Well, I tell you, Bill, it really worries me just to think, I used to have a sweet little girl, you know, named Estelle. You know, and we used to go to school together and we nach'ly grew up together, you know, we grew up together. In other words, I wanted to loved her, and axed her mother for her, and whereat she turned me down, and that cause me to sing the blues. See, I couldn't get her, see… I thought, that's the reason that I thought of “Little Schoolgirl,” see, 'cause me and this girl used to go to school together, you know, and then er, uh, well, her parents thought I wasn't the right boy for her, you understand? And wouldn't make her happy and everything, and so they turned me down. And then I just got to sitting down thinking, you understand? And then I thought of a song, and I started to drinkin' and then I started to singin'… That's the way.

Big Bill: What was you drinkin'?

Sonny Boy: Ah well, you know at that time out in the hills, like that, you couldn't get this good whiskey, you had to drink what you could. I was drinkin', you know, some of that white corn whiskey, you know, made out of the real corn, you know?

Big Bill: I know what you mean.

Sonny Boy: And so that give me the blues… and I started.

Big Bill: OK. Well, now what d' you think about it?

Memphis: Well, about the blues — blues have helped me a lot. I mean, I still have the blues but… when I have troubles, blues is the only thing that helps me. I mean, that's the only way to kind of ease my situation. If I have lots of troubles, for instance, rent situation, and so forth and so on like that, the blues the only thing that gives me consolation.

Big Bill: Well, what about the places where you didn't have to pay rent — just go on a plantation?

Memphis: Well, I still had troubles.

Big Bill: Yeah, I know that.

Memphis: [Laughing] I mean, women troubles and so forth and so on like that. Blues is the only thing that, you know, I can consider.

Big Bill: Well, the thing I think about the blues is — it didn't start in the North — in Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, wha'soever it is. It didn't start in the East — neither in the North — it started in the South, from what I'm thinkin'.

Memphis: Blues started from slavery.

Sonny Boy: Yeah.

Big Bill: And it's what poor people… they got their, they got their rent and their grocery bill and everything all combined together at the same time — that's the way they paid it — they didn't know nothing, anything about rent and those things in those days.

Memphis: But you agree with me that blues help a man out. I mean… [Big Bill: Yeah, for the feeling… you, yeah, you can express your…] …you can sing and play the blues; you feel much better, if your wife left home and left you… something like that…

Alan Lomax: Yeah, but why did they start in the South?

Big Bill: Yeah, I agree, I agree on that. But the thing about it is this, eh… about your — it helps you, yeah, it helps anybody to explain what are they feeling. [Memphis: Expressing your feeling, yeah…] Yeah, that’s the whole… that’s it. But the main thing is why the blues — why a fellow that uh, gets a hold of the blues — why do he have the blues? 

Memphis: Well uh, the blues, and, uh — to my idea now — the blues, and the spirituals are somewhat on the same order, I mean if you have troubles, if you have troubles, you go to church and you sing and you feel happy… [Big Bill: That's right.] And, I mean, you get a little consolation there...

Jack Owens (1904–1997) represented a localized style of guitar blues found in and around the town of Bentonia, Mississippi, between Jackson and Yazoo City. Jack’s old buddy Skip James (1902–1969) first recorded the style in 1931. Its most distinguishing feature is the use of a D-minor guitar tuning. The local musicians shared a number of repertoire items, including this song. Skip James traveled on the folk revival circuit following his “rediscovery” in 1964, while Jack Owens, remained in Bentonia, as the bulwark of the local style. Bud Spires found himself going blind as the result of exposure to chemical pesticides in the 1960s and took up harmonica to preserve some meaning to his life. Jack took him under his wing and encouraged him to develop a sound entirely geared to his own blues. The two musicians would sit with their knees interlocked, sounding as one on pieces like this, playing for other lonely visitors who would come to Jack’s house on weekend nights to hear them wail the blues.

Nevertheless, House had enormous personal prestige in the Mississippi Delta and can be considered to be the main inspiration of both Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters. A former preacher and somewhat of a latecomer to blues, he injected a gospel quality into his singing and might therefore be considered to be the first “soul blues” singer. Recordings of him made by Alan Lomax in 1941 and 1942 eventually led to his “rediscovery” by blues historians in 1964 and a substantial second career that lasted some ten years. His song here is based on Charley Patton’s 1929 record of “Pony Blues,” but House has converted it into a slide guitar masterpiece and extended the “pony” theme to create a more coherent lyric than Patton’s text.

In most cases, these play traditions are as much the province of adults as of children. Indeed, the same songs are often performed by both. Throughout the region, game songs and dances, performed with relish by groups of adults, is an essential component of wakes. Such songs and dances (and the associated games, known as “pass play,” “ring play,” etc.) may also be encountered in other contexts, and are sometimes organized purely for pleasure.

In St. Lucia, there are a number of distinct musical genres associated with play songs and dances, such as jwÈ pÚtÈ, dÈbÚt, and solo. These may be performed either with drum and percussion, or without instrumental accompaniment (in which case vigorous handclapping may supply the rhythm section). In St. Lucia as elsewhere in the Caribbean, the ideal setting for play-song sessions is a night with a full moon, when the near-total darkness that normally envelops rural areas at sunset gives way to brilliant tropical moonshine.

This selection, performed by a group of women as accompaniment to a ring game, appears to be an example of jwÈ pÚtÈ. As Lomax’s Cantometrics system would later reveal, several stylistic features of this performance – the short, syncopated repeating chorus, the vocal timbre, the overlap between the dynamic song leader and the chorus, the leader’s improvisations, and the tight, “metronomic” quality of the clapping – attest to the essentially African style of this Caribbean game song. (The stylistic differences between this example and the primarily European-derived game song on track 5 are easy to hear.) 

The exclamation “woy,” indicating surprise, amusement, fright, etc., is widespread in the French Caribbean and parts of the British and Dutch Caribbean, and can be heard in the popular music of Haiti, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Jamaica, and Suriname. Some linguists consider it derived from Wolof or a related West African language.",Philomene Estephane  ,Female Voice,Women,"Chorus:

St. Lucian village bands are known especially for their kwadril (quadrille) performances, but their repertoires also embrace a number of other ballroom styles. This selection is in the style known as lakonmËt (“la comËte”). LakonmËt (also sometimes called mazouk) is usually danced by couples, and is thought to be the only such ballroom music truly indigenous to St. Lucia. It may be played as a kind of warm-up dance at the beginning of a kwadril evening, or as a closing number after the cycle of five figures normally performed has been completed. Variants of lakonmËt are also associated with wakes, social dances known as dansÈ vyÚlon, and the weekly meetings and annual celebrations of the LawÚz (“La Rose”) Society, a St. Lucian music and dance organization.

As this lovely example shows, the music of Caribbean string bands is not limited to the “hotter,” more driving reworkings of European ballroom dances for which such village bands are known. Slower-tempo dance tunes, played in three-quarter time with a unique old creole charm, are also common throughout the region; in fact, indigenized varieties of the waltz, with hints of polyrhythm and polymeter, abound in the Caribbean.

Standing out in this St. Lucian example is the Caribbean-style strumming of a local version of the banjo. This style, characterized by rapid strokes used for rhythmic embellishment, is widespread in the region. A uniquely Afro-American instrument, the banjo has been used for centuries in the Caribbean and appears to have developed concurrently there and in North America, with overlap and cross-influences between the two areas.",Boy Ramine,Male Voice,Men,"Boy la, mamay-la, Boy pa mÚ,

In one form or another, kalinda, like bÈlÈ, appears to have spread to virtually all those parts of the Caribbean either formerly under French control or significantly affected by the French slave trade. Afro-creole dances called kalinda (kalenda, calenda, etc.) are known to have existed in previous centuries in places as far removed from each other as Louisiana and Trinidad. 

Nowhere has a music-and-dance genre bearing this name left a more significant mark than in Trinidad, where kalinda stickfighting competitions – part of an African-influenced martial-art tradition with its own drumming and singing – were early on incorporated into Carnival and contributed significantly to the development of calypso. Yet despite its historical importance, kalinda is no longer a major part of Carnival in Trinidad, where stickfighting and drumming in general were repeatedly suppressed by British authorities as threatening to the social order. The dance and associated stickfighting tradition remain a vital part of the local Carnival in Carriacou, however, where it has also been incorporated into the Big Drum repertoire, a circumstance that undoubtedly has helped keep it alive. One theory even maintains that kalinda may even have been brought to Trinidad in the first place by migrating Carriacouans in the nineteenth century.

However that may be, the kalinda traditions of the two islands have continued to influence each other into this century. As a result, two kinds of kalinda are now played in Carriacou – an older variety, considered indigenous to the island, and a newer style, said to have been introduced to Carriacou by migrants returning from Trinidad. The association of kalinda with Carnival and stickfighting is apparent in the French Creole lyrics of the present selection, which beseech a police officer, Corporal Williams, to let the singer go, at least until Carnival is over. 

Lomax was told that this song is a “man kalinda,” meaning that it is one of the old, original kalindas traditional to Carriacou. Yet the theme of this song is very similar to that of the tamboo bamboo song from Trinidad. (In Trinidad the British also attempted to suppress the tamboo bamboo bands, which, like the kalinda drums, were sometimes used to provide music for stickfighting.)","Ferguson Adams, Daniel Aikens, Larena Clement, May Fortune, Mannie James, Caddy Lazarus John, Jemina Joseph, Beatrice Lazarus, Tida Lazarus, Mrs. Silvisa, Matilda Noel",Male Voice; 4 Female Voices; 8 Mixed Voices; 2 Boula; 1 Cut Drum; Chac Chac,Mixed adults,"Chorus:

Among the most interesting components of this culture is a neo-African dance-drumming tradition known as Big Drum. Some of the most African music found in all of the Americas has been preserved in the “nation dances” that form the heart of the Big Drum repertoire. As in certain other parts of the New World, such as Brazil, Haiti, and Cuba, and as among the Maroons of Jamaica, a number of dance and music genres in Carriacou have maintained an explicit association with African “nations” from which the ancestors were drawn during the slavery era. 

Among the better-known nations remembered by name in Carriacou are Cromanti, Ibo, Manding, Arada, Temne, Moko, Congo, Chamba, and Banda – each of which has its own songs, rhythms and dance style. Some of these are names of historic places that played an important role in the African slave trade; others are broad ethnolinguistic labels encompassing a variety of African peoples living in the same region.

The nation dances of the Big Drum complex have traditionally played a vital role in Carriacouan social life, maintaining a link between the ancestors and the living – one of the main reasons for holding such dances being to honor these ancestors – and articulating relations between contemporary family groupings. (In addition to its African musical heritage, Carriacou is almost unique in the Caribbean in that its society once featured unilineal descent groups similar in their outlines to those found in many parts of Africa.)

The song heard here belongs to the Arada nation, which refers to ancestors brought from the general region of Dahomey, centered in what is today the Republic of Benin, most of whom were Fon, Ewe, or Mahi. The local name for this nation, Arada, is derived from Ardra (or Allada), an important Dahomean city during the era of the slave trade. Some parallels are Rada in Haiti and Trinidad and Arar· in Cuba, which refer to Dahomean-related social-religious categories and associated music and dance genres in those three islands. In Brazil, on the other hand, the corresponding Dahomean “nations” are known as GÍgÍ or Mina, and among Jamaican and Surinamese Maroons, as Papa.

The West African background of the music in this selection is particularly clearly revealed in the rapid-tempo compound duple meter drumming, the primary pulse of which is divided into triplets. According to an informant of anthropologist Donald Hill, this song is about an individual named Derrick, who was “lost in the high woods”; the singer resolves to find him.","Ferguson Adams, Daniel Aikens, Larena Clement, May Fortune, lead singer, Mannie James, Caddy Lazarus John, Jemina Joseph, Beatrice Lazarus, Tida Lazarus, Mrs. Silvisa, Matilda Noel",Male Voice; 4 Female Voices; 8 Mixed Voices; 2 Boula; 1 Cut Drum; Chac Chac,Mixed adults,"Djerika, ay papa,

The style of drumming heard in this Grenadian selection is similar to Trinidadian kalinda drumming. In both Trinidad and Grenada, kalinda was closely associated with stick-fighting, and was incorporated into Carnival early on. In Grenada, it was also used to accompany a variety of other games. The day Lomax made this recording, the performers decided to use the occasion to play a “chicken game.” His brief notes convey the exuberance of the performance:

Sunny Sunday afternoon. Village green. A little meadow beside a country road. A tree at one end. A crowd of fifty people gathered for amusement. The drums are going. A cock lies in the grass. A game is being organized for which the cock is the prize. A green stalk of banana is buried with about two inches showing above the grass. The player is blindfolded carefully and led 30 yards away down the slope. He has a long stick in his hands. When the drums begin, he starts to dance, kalinda style, and capers his way toward the drums, guiding himself by sound and by what his bare feet can make out of the terrain. He has only one chance at the simulated cock’s head. When he feels sure he has found the spot, he sweeps across the grass with his stick, as if to knock off the cock’s head. The young fellows bragged mightily, paid their dollars, missed [by] a mile. A couple of the older men won every try. Laughter. Joy.","George Hille, boula, Ralph Mitchell, coupé",2 Males; Boula; Coupé,Men,"Smoke, smoke, fire brigade.

Such all-night ceremonies typically feature Protestant hymns known as sankeys, as well as spiritual songs with a more clearly local flavor called anthems. The style of singing used at these wakes has been influenced by the Spiritual Baptist tradition of Trinidad and bears a clear resemblance to the Afro-Protestant singing heard at wakes in that island and in other parts of the former British Caribbean such as Jamaica, which has a similar nine-night tradition. 

Underlying the European-sounding melody and biblical theme of this Carriacouan anthem is a fundamentally Afro-Caribbean performance style manifested not only in the short, antiphonal repeating chorus but also in the improvisational use of vocables and other rhythmic vocalizations to create a complex, communal weave of interlocking parts.","Daniel Aikens, Phina Boatswain, Beatrice Dick, Martha Dick, Lucianne Duncan, Millicent Duncan, Sweet Honey Duncan, Edith Hector, Margaret Henry, Mrs. Jean Pierre, Joseph Jerome, Sheret Joseph, Virginia Joseph, Faith Lawrence, Prince Lawrence, Theresa Lazarus, Derrick Lejen, James Newton, Lawrence Solon, Virginia Sylvester",Male Voice; 21 Mixed Voices,Mixed adults,"Chorus:

Although many songs in this category have an African flavor, others clearly draw on European traditions. The British Caribbean in particular is known as a rich repository for old sea chanteys. This launching song from Carriacou appears to be derived in part from one such chantey, known to collectors as “A Long Time Ago” or “In ’Frisco Bay.” This chantey, which was very popular on English and American ships during the nineteenth century, was originally a halyard song, used for hoisting or lowering sails. In Carriacou, however, it is used for very different purposes, such as launching schooners or honoring deceased sailors at wakes. 

Whereas many versions of “A Long Time Ago” make mention of ’Frisco Bay, this one refers to “Mobile Bay,” which would seem to lend support to those who have argued that West Indian workers and sailors played a major role in the development of British and American chanteying. (Mobile, Alabama, was an important cotton-trading center and one of the bustling American seaports where West Indian sailors and those from other nations met, caroused, and exchanged songs during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.) Although the singing style of the launching song heard here resembles that of British or American chanteymen, Carriacouan sailors use the song to honor the spirits of deceased friends and relatives, thus investing it with a new meaning that faithfully reflects the religious concepts of their African ancestors.","Ferguson Adams, Daniel Aikens, Charles Bristol, Beatrice Dick, Martha Dick, Lucianne Duncan, Millicent Duncan, Sweet Honey Duncan, Edith Hector, Margaret Henry, Newton Joseph, Sheraf Joseph, Virginia Joseph, Faith Lawrence, Prince Lawrence, Derrick Lejen, Lawrence Solon, Virginia Sylvester",Male Voice; 18 Mixed Voices,Men,"Solo: Long time was a very good time.

The inhabitants are thought to be descended from Afro-Scottish and Afro-French boat builders and sailors, and to this day they have a reputation as fine seamen. But in the Carriacouan sense of the word, they are considered “selfish” and standoffish: they are averse to people visiting their island and even object to the police to removing troublemakers, preferring to handle matters themselves.

Carriacouans told stories about their fiercely independent neighbors. For instance there was one about a murder that took place in the ’60s on a sloop plying between Carriacou and Grenada with three Petit Martinican sailors on board. A fight broke out between two of them and one fell overboard. The third sailor tried to help him clamber back on board, but his assailant, still in a passion, pushed him back and he drowned. After arriving in Grenada, the alleged murderer was detained. People said he got a good lawyer who had him released on bail. It was rumored that the bail money involved some bobul (bribe). He returned to Petit Martinique, but the other crewman, feeling he should stand trial for murder, was able to get the case reopened. A Grenadian policeman stationed in Carriacou was sent to Petit Martinique to bring the accused back to St. George’s, Grenada, for trial. When the policeman arrived at the Petit Martinique jetty, he noticed people nearby digging. When he asked them what they were doing, they said they were digging a grave for him if he stepped off the boat. The policeman turned back and told his superiors in Carriacou that he could not pick the man up. They said that if he did not, he would be fired. He refused, was fired, and eventually migrated to England. When no one could be found to bring in the accused, the case was dropped.

In a second version of this story, the accused sailor was released because his family put up bail legitimately. Subsequently, several policemen were asked to pick him up. Not wanting to go to Petit Martinique, they cooked up a story that there was mail awaiting him in Hillsborough, Carriacou. When he came to get his mail, he was captured and taken to Grenada for trial. Again, his family made bail, and he returned to Petit Martinique. But this time when the police tried to take him off the island they were met by residents toting shotguns and pistols and the police had to retreat emptyhanded. The police decided to have the matter, rather than themselves, laid to rest.

For what it is worth, I found the Petit Martinicans to be quite friendly. Furthermore, Petit Martinicans do quite well when they migrate. One district officer (the “mayor”) in Carriacou was from Petit Martinique, as was Carriacou’s most prominent resident in Brooklyn, a medical doctor whose daughter was briefly a television actress.

“Humble-o” explains how Petit Martinicans acquired their singular character. A psychiatrist would have a field day interpreting it. It tells of a pregnant but unmarried girl from Petit Martinique and her babies, a twin girl and boy, who in turn were the progenitors of all subsequent Petit Martinican people. The Church teaching that unmarried women should not have children is reinforced when the girl is refused confirmation in Carricacou, while all the other children from Petit Martinique are eaten by Job Lutins (the devil)! Such stories, told with tongue in cheek, are meant as lessons for children.","Ferguson Adams, Daniel Aikens, Charles Bristol, Beatrice Dick, Martha Dick, Lucianne Duncan, Millicent Duncan, Sweet Honey Duncan, Edith Hector, Margaret Henry, Newton Joseph, Sheraf Joseph, Virginia Joseph, Faith Lawrence, Prince Lawrence, Derrick Lejen, Lawrence Solon, Virginia Sylvester",Male Voice; 10+ Mixed Voices; 2 Boulas; 1 Cut Drum; Chac Chac,Mixed adults,"Beginning song :

Nou ka-ale.

Translation:
Humble oh, where is she?
Quick, we have to go, quick!
We’re going.
We want to go. [Etc.]

Spoken: Krik
Audience: Krak!)

Well that was a lady have a daughter,
And confirmation will be taking place;
That lady live in Petit Martinique, Carriacou;
And that confirmation will be taking place in Carriacou
Because Petit Martinique have no church in those time.

Well, that poor lady leave the daughter home
And come down to make right to sew a-clothes
There was no seamstress in, um —- (Listeners: Petit Martinique!)
Petit Martinique. Let me one talk!

And when she come now the day appear
That all children will come down from Petit Martinique
To come to Carriacou to land in Jean-Pierre Bay
To go down town to receive confirmation
In the Roman Catholic Church.

Well, the first boat arrive; the daughter did not come.
She wait for the second boat; the daughter did not come.

(Song)

Spoken: Krik!  
Listeners: Krak!

At that time that girl prove in family way
And you can’t confirm if you conceive with a child.
She can’t come.

The poor mother don’t know;
The poor mother don’t know if she conceive;
But she go and make all preparations before,
And then expecting her with the boat.

So when the last boat come,
And she ain’ see the daughter,
She take off her kerchief round she head,
And tie she waist and she start to bawl.

(Song)

Spoken: Krik!  
Listeners: Krak!

Well in those time —  in that time,
The daughter did not come on that direction at all.
She ain’t come with the boat,
Because she know that she conceive with a baby.

Well, the last boat come;
The lady did not see.

Well you know, at those time
We don’t have car in Carriacou to take them to town —
They have to walk.
All the candidates form together
And stepping downtown.

Well, when they meet they going down,
They going and pass Belvedere Cross,
Going downtown,
Going to the Roman Catholic Church
To get confirmation.
Bishop is there waiting.

Well, when they going to cross.
You know the road was by Noblaki [?] Bay
And crossing there,
There have a salt-pond there.

There is a man there will take away all —
Will swallow all the children,
All, everybody that pass.

Look here!
As soon as they go to cross
That lagoon 
(Listener: Salt pond!)
 — salt pond,
All gone!
They take away all!

And is only that one girl,
That stay in Petit Martinique;
And that girl come,
And she bring a twin,
A boy and a girl.

That is the onliest people 
That remain in Petit Martinique.

And all the people that leave
To go and see confirmation,
All was swallow by the —
By that man — I forget that man name.

Listeners: He name is Djabloten — The Devil!

Well, all right, no confirmation.
Nobody in Petit Martinique did not confirm
On that day because they all gone,
They did not reach town.

And that girl remain in Petit Martinique.
She make twin, and
They grow up in Petit Martinique.
And you see,
Petit Martinique is one family.

Because if anything wrong in Petit Martinique,
You go there you get dead, because —
And if you get dead there,
No one would not say:
“Well, me kill this man,”
Because they all is one.
You stranger have to keep off.

You see?

That is why, you see,
If you have a daughter, she going to confirm
And she conceive,
She can never go to the Bishop to confirm,
Because she conceive with baby.

Not so you know,
But in the way going — 
She was a candidate
In the way going to confirm,
She get the baby.
And then she remain there.

Is thanks of she that make Petit Martinique green up today.

Krik!   Krak!

The Shango religion of Grenada (known locally as “African work”) is thought to date back to 1849, when some 1,000 Ijesha Yoruba indentured laborers arrived in that island from Nigeria. These post-emancipation immigrants formed close-knit communities in their new island home, where they were able to maintain a strongly Yoruba-based religion and musical tradition. Over time this religion spread to other parts of the island, in the process taking on elements of Christianity. Today it is the main neo-African form of worship in Grenada. Unlike its better-known Trinidadian counterpart, from which it differs in several ways, musically and otherwise, Grenadian Shango remains poorly documented – making these early recordings by Lomax all the more noteworthy.

This song is for Ogun, the Yoruba god of war and metal working. The intricate drumming, the melody exchanged between leader and chorus (in the Yoruba language, though only partly understood by the singers), and the rhythms of the boli, a large rattle made from a gourd covered with beads, are as African in form and style as any music to be found in the Americas. (Similar beaded rattles associated with other New World, Yoruba-based religions include the Cuban g¸iro used in SanterÌa and the Afro-Bahian afoxÈ.) 
The sound of the women’s chorus is reminiscent of Bahian CandomblÈ, one of whose “nations,” Ijex·, comes from the same region of Nigeria as Grenadian Shango, as does the Iyes· style of Cuban SanterÌa.","Christiana Baisdan, Edna Jeremiah, Joseph Jeremiah, Euphemia Jones, Evena McLean, Alice McQueen, Alstead McQueen, Christine McQueen, Emmanuel Babsy McQueen, Irene McQueen, Lena McQueen, Samuel McQueen, Mary Mitchell, drums, rattle",Female Voice; 10 Female Voices; 3 Male Voices; Drums,Mixed adults,,,Alan Lomax with Anna Lomax,1962,ACE Online Archive 2012,"Caribbean Recordings, ACE Online Archive","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress",,

Just as Catholicism, Protestantism, and Yoruba religion have been syncretized to various degrees on Grenada, so have languages. This song is a perfect illustration of the interplay of the three languages on Grenada: French Creole, English, and Yoruba.

Warner-Lewis’s interpretation is as follows: “[This song] is an intriguing instance of a Yoruba song in the transition stage of becoming an English and French Creole one. (Ma) in the first stanza could represent mother, or Yoruba maa (I will), also expressed as English Creole (‘I go’), as in the last line of the first stanza. In the second stanza, the French Creole word for first person, mwe, substitutes for Yoruba first person, mo. The congruence of sound between Lilly, the female name, and Yoruba ile/ule (house) is a further aspect of semantic shift from a Yoruban context to a Caribbean one.

“The context is problematic: As a sacred song, it appears to assert the spiritual authority of the I-persona who knows the rituals of the ‘ile awo’ or house of mysteries: the shrine. Water would form part of such rituals, and ceremonies for Lilly would require the use of water. The Yoruba word ewo is a caution to avoid a particular place and is used when water, ritual or otherwise, is being thrown. But the word here may also contain a veiled threat against those who order the life of the abused I-persona. The change in the second stanza to awo (spiritual secret), if intentional, suggests a sacred reading of ile/ule (house). Or the initial Ma may refer to a water goddess, such as Yemoja, who is being supplicated to bring her waves to take away the food offerings made by Lilly and left on the shoreline. The song may be a secular one, or it may be a sacred song transitioning to a secular theme, in which relations between servant or slave and master or mistress are being exposed. Such an interpretation is supported by the self-referent ‘nigger,’ which was normative in the plantation and colonial eras.”

In the original sequence as recorded by Lomax, a song to Shango comes just before the one below to Dada, which immediately precedes a possession. The singer of “Bring Me Water for Lilly” may have sensed that a possession was imminent, and this song may contain yet another veiled allusion to that event.","Christiana Baisdan, Edna Jeremiah, Joseph Jeremiah, Euphemia Jones, Evena McLean, Alice McQueen, Alstead McQueen, Christine McQueen, Emmanuel Babsy McQueen, Irene McQueen, Lena McQueen, Samuel McQueen, Mary Mitchell",Female Voice; 10 Female Voices; 3 Male Voices; Drums,Mixed adults,"Ma, bring the water for Lilly.

“Dada is the mythical King of Oyo who abdicated in favor of his brother Shango. Dada was famous for his matted and curly hair; hence, he is the patron god of children born with such hair.”

Immediately after this song, the drumming stopped — there had been a spirit possession during the ceremony. Since Shango is invoked in Grenada to bring rain and a good harvest, and since this song cycle may have been recorded during a Thanksgiving feast tied to the agricultural cycle, the orisha who has “come down” may very well be Shango. Dada is not usually given in lists of known orishas for Grenada, but he is the brother of Shango, and the two are often mentioned in the same song, as they are here and elsewhere in the Caribbean.","Christiana Baisdan, Edna Jeremiah, Joseph Jeremiah, Euphemia Jones, Evena McLean, Alice McQueen, Alstead McQueen, Christine McQueen, Emmanuel Babsy McQueen, Irene McQueen, Lena McQueen, Samuel McQueen, Mary Mitchell",Female Voice; 10 Female Voices; 3 Male Voices; Drums,Mixed adults,"Se e gberin o

A maroon is a festive occasion in which those who come together to give a helping hand are rewarded with food and drink. Most maroons are held for purposes of cultivation. (In Carriacou, the term maroon has an additional sense, sometimes being used to refer to a kind of ritual feast in the Big Drum tradition.) In Grenada, work songs have traditionally played an important role in maroons, being used to coordinate various tasks and to make hard work more enjoyable. As in other parts of the Caribbean, work songs in Grenada have been drawn from diverse sources.

Shortknee is the name of a particular masked character with a long history in Grenada. An outgrowth of an older Carnival figure known as Pierrot Grenade (believed to have first appeared on the island in the seventeenth century), Shortknee is an aggressive character who, dressed in a distinctive costume typified by baggy trousers tied above the knee, roams the countryside during Carnival. Chanting loudly as he goes, he makes belligerent motions, jabbing at the air and sometimes throwing white powder at those who cross his path; some Shortknees stop from time to time to recite elaborate speeches combining French Creole and English. Competitive speech-making and boasting may lead to fighting, and in some areas the Shortknee and stick-fighting traditions have merged. In the past, bands of Shortknees from different villages and districts would often meet and clash, sometimes resulting in ongoing feuds.

The lyrics of the song featured here, in a mixture of French Creole and Grenadian English Creole, mention the rival villages of Chantimelle and Mount Rueil, which are famous for being at the center of Shortknee feuding. When the lead singer speaks of “me bull jumping,” he is likely referring to the long stick, called a “bull,” used as a whip by the Shortknee (and before him, by the Pierrot Grenade) to punish those who arouse his ire. Because of the unruly demeanor of Shortknee bands and the perceived potential for violence, there have been periodic attempts since colonial times to suppress this and other local masquerades (thus the references in this song to being detained in the police station). Continuing attempts to curb the boisterous behavior of such masked performers — culminating in the Carnival Regulation Act of 1990 — have led to the decline of Grenada’s indigenous Carnival, which has been largely replaced by a tamer, institutionalized version modeled on the present-day Trinidad Carnival. But the unregulated Shortknees made something of a comeback in the 1980s, and they remain active, particularly in St. Patrick’s, where Lomax made this recording.","Claudius Andall, George Claude, Alexis George, Simpson Jeremiah, Irene McQueen",Voice; 5 Mixed Voices,Mixed adults,"Chorus:

Up to the late 1950s, Grenada was home to a distinctive, local Afro-Caribbean Carnival based on folk traditions and costumed characters of its own, such as Shortknee and Pierrot Grenade (some of which had earlier influenced the Carnival of Trinidad). Well-known local calypso singers such as Papa Edmund and Lord Roamer usually performed with village string bands featuring some combination of banjo, guitar, cuatro, and chorus singers. These calypsonians were still known, as elsewhere in the French-influenced Caribbean, as “chantwells.” In the late 1950s, the Grenadian chantwells Lord Melody (a different individual from the better-known Lord Melody of Trinidad) and Quo Vadis introduced organized calypso tents and formal competitions based on the Trinidadian model. Calypso in Grenada, as in the other Anglophone islands, soon came to be dominated by the sounds emanating from Trinidad, a trend that continues today. The older string-band sound heard in this selection has almost disappeared from Carnival in Grenada, having long ago been displaced by the more “modern” strains of steel band and soca music. The lyrics of the song reflect the subversive spirit of Carnival, humorously overturning the norms of “proper” everyday social life; temporarily freed from normal constraints, the “saga gals” (fancy, showy, dressed-up girls) leave their watchful mothers at home and venture out on their own to take over the town.","Claudius Andall, George Claude, Alexis George, Simpson Jeremiah, Irene McQueen",Voice; 5 Mixed Voices,Mixed adults,"Chorus:

In 1528, Hernán Cortés returned to Spain from Mexico, bearing the Aztec recipe for xocolatl *(chocolate drink) with him. The drink was initially received unenthusiastically and it was not until sugar was added that it became a popular drink in the Spanish courts. There were attempts to satisfy Spanish domestic demand by planting cacao in Spanish territories such as Santo Domingo (now the Dominican Republic and Haiti), Trinidad, and Fernando Po (now Bioko), an island off the West African coast, but these initially came to nothing. The cultivation of cacao on a large scale by European mercantile nations began in earnest in the late seventeenth century. France introduced the crop to Martinique and St. Lucia in 1660 and to Grenada in 1714. Since then it has been one of the island’s principal exports.

Before shipment for processing, the cocoa fruit is harvested and cut open and the cocoa beans are extracted. After fermentation, the beans are placed in trays called “cocoa drawers,’’ and workers “tramp” or walk.","Daniel Alexander (lead vocal), Theophilus Daisy, Sonny Francis, Saville Greenridge, Norman Miller",Male Voice; 4 Male Voices; Tramping; Hand Claps,Men,,,Alan Lomax with Anna Lomax,1962,ACE Online Archive 2012,"Caribbean Recordings, ACE Online Archive","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress",,
